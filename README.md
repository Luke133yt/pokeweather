PokeWeather is a simple weather app created with Python, inspired by the love for Pokémon.

## About

This application was developed for fun, combining weather information with elements from the Pokémon universe.
The sprites used in the app belong to Pokémon, and all rights are reserved by The Pokémon Company, Game Freak, and Nintendo.

## Usage

To run the app, ensure you have the following requirements installed:
- Python
- tkinter (library)
- ttkbootstrap (library)
- requests (library)

  Windows:
  py -m pip install tkinter
  py -m pip install ttkbootstrap
  py -m pip install requests

  Linux:

  JUST IN CASE I'VE MADE AN EXECUTABLE VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE YOU CAN FIND [HERE](https://github.com/Luke133yt/pokeweather/releases/tag/1.0), JUST FOLLOWING THE ISTRUCTION ON THAT PAGE

Additionally, you need to create an account on [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) and generate an API key.
Insert this API key in apikey.txt file

Once set up, you're ready to go! Enjoy tracking the weather with a touch of Pokémon magic.

## Features
