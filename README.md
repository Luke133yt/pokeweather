PokeWeather is a simple weather app created with Python, inspired by the love for Pokémon.

## About

This application was developed for fun, combining weather information with elements from the Pokémon universe.
The sprites used in the app belong to Pokémon, and all rights are reserved by The Pokémon Company, Game Freak, and Nintendo.

## Usage

To run the app, ensure you have the following requirements installed:
- tkinter
- ttkbootstrap
- requests

Additionally, you need to create an account on [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) and generate an API key.
Insert this API key into the 16th line of the code.

Once set up, you're ready to go! Enjoy tracking the weather with a touch of Pokémon magic.

## Features

- **Persistent City Search:** The last searched city is saved in `last.txt`. When you reopen the app, it quickly displays the weather for the last searched city, similar to mobile weather apps.
  
- **Theme Customization:** You can change the app's theme, and your selection will be remembered for future use.
