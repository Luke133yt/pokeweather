# PokeWeather
A simple weather app made with python and love for the pokèmon

i've made this app just because i think this was fun.

The sprites that i use are not mine, they are from Pokèmon and the rights are from The Pokèmon Company, Game Freak and Nintendo.

USAGE

for run the following requirements
- tkinter
- ttkbootstrap
- requests

and then make an account on openweathermap.org and generate an API key, then paste it on the 16th line

Then you are ready to go ENJOY!

SOME COOL FEATURE

- The last city that you search, is gonna be saved on last.txt, so the next time that you open the software you are gonna have a quick result, like the weather app for mbile phone.

- i add the possibility to change theme and they are permanent
